1. Did your graph match your runtime analysis expectations?

In terms of graph and Big-O analysis, they both match in explanation. However, contrary to my initial expectation that GPU codes will inherently work better, the performances of naive GPU actually worked worse due to its small processor number.  

2. What went well with this assignment?

I think talking about the Big-O analysis in class helped a lot. Because then, I had an idea of how to approach implementing scanning and addition in CPU and GPU. 

3. What was difficult?

The most difficult part of the assignment was doing them both in CPU and GPU as their implementation is different. The timing function in C was also new and confusing at first. 

4. How would you approach differently?

I would have went to the office hours sooner to ask about timing before trying to implement it myself because I spend more hour than expected/needed.

5. Anything else you want me to know?

This assignment was actually fun to implement.
